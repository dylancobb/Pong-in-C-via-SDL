# Making Pong in C using the SDL library

This project is my way of getting to grips with the basics of using the SDL library with C. My aims are to learn the following principles:
- How to create a window in SDL.
- How to work with APIs in C in general.
- How a basic game loop works.
  - How to poll user input, manage game state and render pixels onto a screen.
- How to use delta time to ensure predictable behaviour with flexible framerates.
- How to structure programs whose source code is split across multiple files, since my previous attempts ended up a bit chaotic.
